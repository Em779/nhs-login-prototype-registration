      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        We're introducing an NHS login to make it easier and quicker for you to see your personal health information online.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        We're testing the NHS login with a group of people. It'll be available to the public in 2019.
      </p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">
        How to set up your NHS login
      </h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        You can set up your NHS login (username and password) using your email address and mobile phone.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        You don't need your NHS Number to set up your NHS login, but it could help us to find your health record if you do know it.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        After you have set up your NHS login, you'll need to go through a further one-off step to prove who you are.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        This is to make sure that we connect you correctly to your confidential health and care information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">
        Proving who you are
      </h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        The quickest and simplest way is to complete this step online. We'll ask you to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>take a photo of an ID document, such as a UK passport or driving licence</li>
        <li>record a short video of yourself reading out loud 4 numbers that we've sent to you</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        We're working on other ways for you to do this if you don't have photo ID or you'd prefer not to complete your ID checks online.
      </p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">
        Other ways of proving who you are
      </h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        Instead of using photo ID and a video to prove who you are, if you already use GP online services you'll be able to use your registration details.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        We're also working with GOV.UK Verify to let you re-use GOV.UK Verify accounts to access NHS websites and apps.
      </p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">
        How you can use your NHS login
      </h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        Once you have proven who you are, you can use your NHS login repeatedly without having to prove who you are each time.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        You'll initially be able to use the NHS login to access the NHS App.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhs-app">NHS App</a> is a simple way to connect to digital NHS health services on your mobile phone or tablet.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        For example, you'll be able to book a GP appointment, order repeat prescriptions and see your GP medical records.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        In the future, you'll be able to use your NHS login to access many other health and social care services online.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        It'll mean you don't have to remember lots of different usernames and passwords.
      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        It'll mean you don't have to remember lots of different usernames and passwords.
      </p>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">
        Your data is stored securely
      </h2>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        NHS login stores and processes your personal information securely and in line with strict standards.

      </p>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        Other health services, websites and apps that use NHS login have to meet NHS Digital's <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/information-standards-and-data-collections-including-extractions/publications-and-notifications/standards-and-collections/dcb3051-identity-verification-and-authentication-standard-for-digital-health-and-care-services">standard on proving identity.</a>
